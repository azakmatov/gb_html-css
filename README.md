# gb_html-css
Test on the subject of HTML and CSS in GB

1. Added code to the js to open the menu when clicking on the burger button, added all the necessary styles, checked the typographer, validity.
Made the logo a link to the main page, added hover effects, added semantic elements if possible, added images in SVG format, checked the site on large and small screens.
2. If possible, checked for a large number of texts, indents for input fields.
3. I am posting the finished site on github for verification, since free hostings often have problems with certificates for opening sites via HTTPS.
4. I added immobility to the header and pop-up menu, as well as a shadow for the header to emphasize the borders of the header from other blocks when scrolling.
Thank you!
